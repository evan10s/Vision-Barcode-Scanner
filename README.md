This Android app integrates with my other Lottery v2 web app.

The app will automatically scan barcodes, then send them to a linked kiosk within Lottery v2.  This makes it easy to run the lottery as a kiosk, with users simply scanning their barcode ticket to identify themselves.

This repo is largely based on:
